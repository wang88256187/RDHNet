# RDHNet: A Multi-Agent Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

RDHNet is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm proposed to address complex decision-making problems in multi-agent environments. This repository provides an implementation of RDHNet, which aims to optimize the collaboration between multiple agents by utilizing a unique approach that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
